    Program name: board.py
    Description: main file that allows two players to play battleship
    Inputs:
    Coordinate for shooting: Users input a grid coordinate (e.g., "A3") to take a shot.
    Movement for placing ships: Users input movement commands to position their ships:
        -W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right) for navigation.
        -R to rotate the ship.
        -C to confirm the ship placement.
        -Q to quit.
    Number of ships: Users input the number of ships to play with (between 1 and 5).
    Confirmation: Players press Enter to confirm or continue certain actions (e.g., turn change or ship confirmation).
    Function Input Parameters:
        -shot: str: The shot taken by a player (e.g., "A3").
        -enemy: Player: The opponent's Player object to check for hit or miss.
        -line_pos_x, line_pos_y, size, horizontal: Coordinates and orientation for placing a ship.
        -grid: The current state of the board/grid for display and manipulation.
        -p1_selection: Boolean value indicating if Player 1 has completed their ship selection.
    Outputs:
    Printed Messages (Console Outputs):
        -"Choose your coordinate to shoot!" or similar messages during gameplay.
        -Messages like "HIT!", "MISS!", and "SHIP DESTROYED!" for shot results.
        -Victory messages such as "Player 0 Wins!" or "Player 1 Wins!" when a player wins.
        -Movement prompts like "Move (W=up, A=left, S=down, D=right, R=rotate, C=confirm, Q=quit):".
        -Grid display during ship placement and gameplay using display_grid().
        -"Overlap detected! Move the line to a new position." if ships overlap.
        -Final boards for both players at the end of the game.
    Return Values:
        -checkHit(): No return, but it prints the result of a shot (hit, miss, ship destroyed).
        -shootShip(): Returns a string representing the shot's coordinate.
        -checkWin(): Returns True if the game should continue and False if the game is won.
        -move_line(): Returns an updated grid with the line placed and the confirmed coordinates.
        -shipPlacement(): Returns two lists of coordinates representing each player's confirmed ship placements.
        -translateCoordinates(): Converts and returns integer tuple coordinates into string grid coordinates (e.g., A3).
        -goodInput(): Returns the number of ships chosen by the user.
